					  <h3>Kills per Minute</h3>
					  <div>
						<p>
						This feature outputs a ratio of Kills divided by Minutes rounded to nearest hundredths place.
						The display is updated for each kill as well as every second. This allows higher accuracy than simply updating every minute.
						</p>
						<p>
						The time starts as soon as the K/min window is opened and can be reset using the "Reset Counters" hotkey or via the button in Settings.
						</p>
					  </div>
					  <h3># Headshot</h3>
					  <div>
						<p>
						This feature simply displays the number of headshots achieved by the player. The counter starts when WarShadow launches and can be reset using the "Reset Counters" hotkey or via the button in Settings.
						</p>
					  </div>
					  <h3>% Headshot</h3>
					  <div>
						<p>
						This feature displays the result of: <# of Headshots>/<# of Kills> X 100. It is updated after each kill. The counter starts when WarShadow launches and can be reset using the "Reset Counters" hotkey or via the button in Settings.
						</p>
					  </div>
					  <h3>HS Streak Average</h3>
					  <div>
						<p>
						This feature shows how many headshots the player gets in quick succession on average.
						<br>
						Examples: If a player only got brain annhilators the window would always display "5 Avg". If a player never got a skull hunter, head crasher, brain smasher, or brain annhilator the window would always display "1 Avg".
						</p>
						<p>
						The counter starts when WarShadow launches and can be reset using the "Reset Counters" hotkey or via the button in Settings.
						</p>
					  </div>
					  <h3>Crosshair</h3>
					  <div>
						<p>
						This feature allows the user to use a custom crosshair in Warface. The user can use preloaded crosshairs or upload their own.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						<h4>Setting it up</h4>
						Open the Settings page and scroll down to the Crosshair section. If you use right click to aim down sights, make sure the box is checked. Select Hold-to-Aim or Toggle-Aim so that it is the same as your Warface settings. If you use Right Click to ADS you are done! 
						<br>
						If you use a custom key to aim, click "Grab ADS" and push your ADS key. To make sure that the app recieved the correct key, push it again. If the text below the button flashes grey you are all finished!
						</p>
						<p>
						<h4>"Uploading" your own crosshair</h4>
						To use a custom crosshair all you need to do is create a folder called "Crosshair" and put it on your desktop. Then get a .png file of your crosshair and put it in the folder. See below for naming the file.						
						</p>
						<p>
						I have provided 10 "slots" for custom user crosshairs. The available file names are:
						<br>
						customX0.png, customX1.png, customX2.png, customX3.png, customX4.png, customX5.png, customX6.png, customX7.png, customX8.png, and customX9.png.
						</p>
						</div>
					  <h3>Problems and Troubleshooting</h3>

					  I do not anticipate any issues with these features, but if there are any problems please message me via Steam, Warface.com, or email.

						<h3>General Recording Info</h3>
						<div>
							<p>
							Q: Does the recording work like ShadowPlay or more traditional programs?
							<br>
							A: Both. Auto-Recording works like ShadowPlay, but the recording window has the option to do start-stop recordings as well.
							<br><br>
							Q: Why won't the Auto-Recording box stay checked?
							<br>
							A: It is designed to uncheck itself if the recording process didn't start correctly. This is usually because it wasn't clicked when the user had a game running and in focus. If this wasn't the issue, the recording isn't cooperating with your system. Try other settings and check what error you are getting.
							<br><br>
							Q: Why does the program lag when I click Auto-Record or I click the power button in the recording window?
							<br>
							A: These buttons are both enabling the ShadowPlay feature and it takes a few seconds for Overwolf to get everything ready.
							<br><br>
							Q: Why didn't my recording save?
							<br>
							A: Do you remember the slider in Settings that lets you choose how much video you wanted to save after the auto-Recording event happened? When an Auto-Record event is triggered, my app waits that long before saving the video.
							The reason for this, is because Overwolf only allows one recording at a time. If I didn't wait till after the time was finished, other Auto-Recording events are unsuccessful because the first call is hogging the recording.
							<br><br>
							Q: Why should I use Warshadow for recording instead of ReplayHUD?
							<br>
							A: 3 reasons. 
							<br>1) "Auto-Recording", it takes all the recording for you so you can focus on playing the game. 
							<br>2) The option to do longer videos. ReplayHUD currently only allows 40 second videos. Mine does 3 minutes for Auto-Recording, but I haven't found a time limit for start-stop recording. 
							<br>3) No recharge time. ReplayHUD currently makes you wait 40 seconds before taking another recording.
							<br><br>

			<h3>
				<h1>NEEDS TO BE UPDATED</h1>
				
				<ul>
						<li>This program is pretty straightforward once you understand it, but there are a few aspects of it that aren't immediately obvious.
					</li><br><li>
					<h2><u>HUD elements </u></h2> <br>
						These are little pop-up windows you can launch by clicking a checkbox on the menu. These windows display some sort of information to aide the user. The information is updated in constantly. They can be moved to different locations on the screen by dragging them. Upon double clicking the image on the pop-up, the window's position is saved. The next time the window is launched it will relocate to where it was last time. To close a window, simply un-select its checkbox. 
					</li><br><li>
					<u>Smoke Timer </u> <br>
						This is one of the more practical features in the app. When you throw a smoke grenade, a window will pop up automatically and count down how many seconds are left on that smoke grenade. It will say "NOW" when the smoke is almost out and then close automatically.
					</li><br><li>
					<u># of Headshots</u> <br>
					This is a simple counter that will count how many headshots you have gotten and update in real-time.
					</li><br><li>
					<u>% of Headshots</u> <br>
					This will use your total kills and headshots to calculate what percent of your kills are headshots in realtime.
					</li><br><li>
					<u>HS Chain AVG</u> <br>
					This feature will track your headshot combos. It will then calculate how many headshots your average "headshot streak" consists of in realtime. Note: Because there are no built in headshot combos after brain annhilator, the max avg is 5. I may try to extend it in the future.
					</li><br><li>
					<u>KDR</u> <br>
						This feature will track your PvP Kill/Death ratio for your whole session so you can see how you did more accurately.
					</li>
					<br><br><br>
					<li>
					<h2><u>Capturing</u></h2><br>
						This feature takes video recordings and screenshots. It has 2 modes: Auto-capture and Manual. 
					<br> 
						The way that video recording works in this app is similar to that of ShadowPlay by Nvidia. First a recording process is started in the background. This can be done by selecting the AutoCapture checkbox, or clicking the "Start Recording" button.
						 This process doesn't save anything. The differences between Manual and Automatic is how they "capture" the recordings made in the background.
					<br>
						The way to use Auto-capture is to select the corresponding checkbox in the menu. This checkbox has the potential to lag a bit because upon selecting it the background recording process is started and this can be resource intensive for a few seconds.
						After the background process has started, video capturing will be done automatically based on the settings you have chosen under the "Recording" window.
						</li><br><li>
					<h2><u>OverWolf Settings </u></h2> <br>
						There is an overwolf setting so that you can only click on the app's windows when hit hotkey(s).
					<br>
						There is also an option to choose which browser links will open in.
					<br>
						The "open video after capturing" setting may not function correctly.
