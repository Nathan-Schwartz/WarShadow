		<h1>NEEDS TO BE UPDATED</h1>
		
		<ul>
			<li>This program is pretty straightforward once you understand it, but there are a few aspects of it that aren't immediately obvious.
		</li><br><li>
		<h2><u>HUD elements </u></h2> <br>
			These are little pop-up windows you can launch by clicking a checkbox on the menu. These windows display some sort of information to aide the user. The information is updated in constantly. They can be moved to different locations on the screen by dragging them. Upon double clicking the image on the pop-up, the window's position is saved. The next time the window is launched it will relocate to where it was last time. To close a window, simply un-select its checkbox. 
		</li><br><li>
		<u>Smoke Timer </u> <br>
			This is one of the more practical features in the app. When you throw a smoke grenade, a window will pop up automatically and count down how many seconds are left on that smoke grenade. It will say "NOW" when the smoke is almost out and then close automatically.
		</li><br><li>
		<u># of Headshots</u> <br>
		This is a simple counter that will count how many headshots you have gotten and update in real-time.
		</li><br><li>
		<u>% of Headshots</u> <br>
		This will use your total kills and headshots to calculate what percent of your kills are headshots in realtime.
		</li><br><li>
		<u>HS Chain AVG</u> <br>
		This feature will track your headshot combos. It will then calculate how many headshots your average "headshot streak" consists of in realtime. Note: Because there are no built in headshot combos after brain annhilator, the max avg is 5. I may try to extend it in the future.
		</li><br><li>
		<u>KDR</u> <br>
			This feature will track your PvP Kill/Death ratio for your whole session so you can see how you did more accurately.
		</li>
		<br><br><br>
		<li>
		<h2><u>Capturing</u></h2><br>
			This feature takes video recordings and screenshots. It has 2 modes: Auto-capture and Manual. 
		<br> 
			The way that video recording works in this app is similar to that of ShadowPlay by Nvidia. First a recording process is started in the background. This can be done by selecting the AutoCapture checkbox, or clicking the "Start Recording" button.
			 This process doesn't save anything. The differences between Manual and Automatic is how they "capture" the recordings made in the background.
		<br>
			The way to use Auto-capture is to select the corresponding checkbox in the menu. This checkbox has the potential to lag a bit because upon selecting it the background recording process is started and this can be resource intensive for a few seconds.
			After the background process has started, video capturing will be done automatically based on the settings you have chosen under the "Recording" window.
			</li><br><li>
		<h2><u>OverWolf Settings </u></h2> <br>
			There is an overwolf setting so that you can only click on the app's windows when hit hotkey(s).
		<br>
			There is also an option to choose which browser links will open in.
