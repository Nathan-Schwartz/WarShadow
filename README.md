This app was made as a submission for the Nvidia Overwolf App Challenge that started in August of 2015. It was my first foray into javascript and web development in general.

I was pleased to learn that I placed first in the Warface - Game Related category. 

### Technologies used:
* Google Charts API

### Features
1. Low profile HUD elements to make real-time statistic tracking possible.
2. Interractive in-game weapon and armor analysis and comparison using Google Charts for data visualization.

5. Hot-key triggered recording that utilizes Overwolf's ShadowPlay API.
6. Gameplay triggered "auto recording" with customizable video quality, length, and many triggers to choose from.
7. Custom Crosshair functionality (Toggling is depracted due to a lack of support for all mice).
